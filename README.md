# Age Detection using OpenCV and Deep Learning

This project utilizes OpenCV and deep learning techniques to classify the age of individuals from facial images.

## Overview

Age detection is achieved through a pre-trained deep neural network model that analyzes facial features to predict the age of a person.

## Features

- **Age Classification:** Predict the age of individuals from images.
- **Python Implementation:** Implemented in Python for ease of use and integration.
- **Deep Learning:** Utilizes deep neural networks for accurate age prediction.
